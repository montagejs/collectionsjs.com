-   unzip

---

Returns an array of the respective values in this collection and in each
collection provided as an argument.

Thus, if this collection contains numbers and another collection contains
corresponding letters, `zip` would return an array of number to letter pairs.

`unzip` is the non-variadic cousin of `zip` and is equivalent to a matrix
transpose.
