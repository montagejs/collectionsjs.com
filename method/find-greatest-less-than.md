Finds the largest value less than the given value, returning the node at which
it was found, or undefined.

Values are compared using the collectionâ€™s intrinsic `contentEquals` and
`contentCompare`, determined at time of construction.

This is fast (logarithmic) and may rotate the underlying splay tree.
