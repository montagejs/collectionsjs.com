Finds the first value within a collection that passes a test.

This method is defined by an ECMAScript 6 proposal and documented on [MDN][].

Version 1 of collections supports a deprecated alternative to `find(callback,
thisp)`, [find(value, equals, start)][find-value].
In version 2, this method has been renamed `findValue`.
